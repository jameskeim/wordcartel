# B1+B2 — word-boundary wrap + nested-list indent (one document-text-rendering effort)

**Status:** draft — pending Codex + Fable spec review
**Effort:** B1 (word-boundary wrap, `Larger`) + B2 (sub-list bullet indent + hanging indent,
`Medium-small`) — **combined by user decision 2026-07-04**: document text rendering updates
in one effort, not two.
**Date:** 2026-07-04 · **Facts as of:** `9e13164` (post-H1; layout.rs = wordcartel-core,
wrap loop :260-:292; md_parse.rs `apply_block_prefix_conceal` :153-:327)

## Why

The soft-wrap is greedy per-grapheme (layout.rs:260-292): when `col + vg.width > vw` the
overflowing grapheme moves to the next row — words break mid-word at the viewport edge.
This is the backlog's highest-value rendering fix. Separately, nested list items render as
`•   sub` — `apply_block_prefix_conceal` (md_parse.rs:252-291) conceals the marker but the
leading indent SPACES survive as visible graphemes while the `"• "` glyph always paints at
column 0. The two meet at the wrap loop: fixing B2 by folding the indent into the prefix
makes wrapped nested items hang correctly for free, because continuation rows already reset
to `prefix_width` (layout.rs:281) and the renderer already paints a matching
`" ".repeat(prefix_width)` spacer (render.rs:445-446, :510-:511). **Hanging indent already
exists** — B2's job is to make `prefix_width` tell the truth for nested items.

## Decisions (user-approved 2026-07-04)

1. **One effort, both items** — document text rendering updates in a single pass.
2. **Break rules = UAX #14** (fork 1 = B, revised from whitespace-only when the user asked
   for hyphen breaking): new dependency `unicode-linebreak` in `wordcartel-core` (tiny,
   table-driven, no unsafe — compatible with `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`; fits the existing
   `unicode-segmentation`/`unicode-width` family). Hand-rolled hyphen heuristics were
   rejected as re-deriving the standard case-by-case.
3. **Unconditional; no config key** (fork 2 = A), with ONE role-based exception:
   `BlockRole::CodeBlock` lines keep today's grapheme wrap (UAX #14 breaks at hyphens/
   spaces actively hurt code readability). No `[view]` wrap axis; if a future need appears
   the seam is the same `if` this exception uses.

## Design

### D1. Break-opportunity computation (layout.rs, before the wrap loop)

Break positions are computed on the **visible text** — concealment changes adjacency
(`"**bold**text"` renders `boldtext`; a break legal in the raw string may be illegal in the
rendered one and vice versa). Mechanically, after the `vgs: Vec<VG>` vector is built
(layout.rs:218-238): concatenate `vg.text` in order (this equals the rendered row content
by construction), run `unicode_linebreak::linebreaks(&visible)` once (linear, one small
state machine — same complexity class as the segmentation pass already done per line), and
map each returned byte offset to the VG index whose text starts at that offset (offsets
from `linebreaks` fall on grapheme starts of the concatenation; collect into a
`Vec<usize>` of VG indices that are legal break points, ascending). Mandatory breaks
(BreakOpportunity::Mandatory) cannot occur mid-line — `layout()` receives one logical line
with no `\n` — except the algorithm's end-of-text break, which is ignored.

The computation is skipped entirely for `role == BlockRole::CodeBlock` (decision 3) and
for lines whose visible width can never overflow — the existing cheap path stays cheap.

### D2. The wrap loop (layout.rs:260-292 reworked)

State added to the loop: `row_start_vg` (index of the first VG on the current row) and
`last_break` (the most recent legal break index ≤ current VG, maintained by advancing a
cursor over the D1 vector — O(1) amortized). The overflow branch becomes:

- **Whitespace never triggers a wrap.** If the current VG's text is ASCII space or tab, it
  is placed at the current col even when `col + width > vw` — trailing whitespace hangs
  past the edge (standard word-processor behavior; a continuation row never starts with
  the space the user just typed). Law 3 is amended accordingly (see Invariants).
- Otherwise, on `col + vg.width > vw && col > prefix_width`:
  - if a legal break exists with `row_start_vg < break ≤ current index`: the row ends at
    the break — VGs from the break to the current index (exclusive) are RE-PLACED onto the
    new row starting at `prefix_width` (their already-pushed `Placed` entries are moved:
    row += 1, cols recomputed from `prefix_width`). The re-placement is bounded by the row
    width (≤ vw cells), preserving the hot path's O(visible) class — each VG moves at most
    once per row boundary.
  - if no legal break exists on the row (one unbroken token wider than the row): fall back
    to the existing grapheme break (the current VG opens the new row). The existing
    single-grapheme guard (`col > prefix_width`) is unchanged — a grapheme wider than
    `vw - prefix_width` still places alone on its row.
- CodeBlock lines never consult breaks (D1 skipped) — behavior byte-identical to today.

Zero-width VGs keep today's handling (placed at current col, no overflow test,
layout.rs:266-273). The `desired_col`/`snap_to_stop`/`enter_from_*` machinery is untouched
— it operates on the resulting `Placed` geometry.

### D3. B2 — nested-list indent conceal (md_parse.rs:252-291, ListItem arm ONLY)

Today: `start` = count of leading space bytes; marker bytes concealed; positions
`0..start` stay VISIBLE. New: positions `0..start` are ALSO concealed, and the prefix
glyph becomes **indent + marker**:

- unordered: `format!("{}• ", indent_str)` where `indent_str` reproduces the leading
  whitespace's display width — spaces copied as-is; a leading TAB contributes
  `TAB_WIDTH = 4` spaces (matching layout.rs's tab expansion, :192-:198, so the glyph
  width equals what the raw indent would have occupied).
- ordered: `format!("{}{}. ", indent_str, ordinal)` — identical treatment
  (md_parse.rs:275-289).

`prefix_width` (layout.rs:245-258) derives from the glyph string unchanged — it now equals
indent + marker width, so: the bullet paints at its indent level (`  • sub`), text follows
at the right column, and wrapped continuation rows hang under the item's TEXT (the
existing `col = prefix_width` reset + render spacer do this with zero render changes).
Generic for any nesting depth. **Blockquotes are OUT of scope** (their leading spaces stay
visible — md_parse.rs:239-250 untouched); headings/code/thematic breaks untouched.

### D4. Invariant amendments (layout.rs proptest laws :751-:1082)

- **Law 3 (softwrap fidelity, :838-:882)** amends its width bound: every row's width ≤ vw,
  EXCEPT (a) a single grapheme wider than the available width (existing exemption) and
  (b) trailing whitespace VGs, which may extend past vw (D2's hang rule).
- **Law 4 (active identity, :890-:909)** unchanged and still binding: every visible byte
  is placed exactly once, no gaps — the D2 re-placement must preserve total coverage
  (hanging whitespace is placed, never dropped).
- **Law 5 (desired-col round-trip, :918-:941)** unchanged.
- **New law W1 (no needless mid-word break):** for every non-CodeBlock row boundary, either
  the break coincides with a UAX #14 opportunity of the visible text, or no opportunity
  existed strictly inside that row (fallback), or the boundary is the logical line start.
- **New law W2 (B2 alignment):** for a list-item line with leading indent, the glyph width
  equals indent display width + marker width, and `Placed` cols on every row start at
  `prefix_width`.

### D5. Consumers — verified unaffected (evidence from the 2026-07-04 code map)

`ColMap`'s contract (`source_to_visual`/`visual_to_source`/`row_end_col`/`snap_to_stop`)
is geometry-agnostic; consumers verified to handle arbitrary row-break positions:
`screen_pos` (nav.rs:83-124), `ensure_visible` (:401-483), `offset_at_cell` (:909-937),
`move_home/end/up/down/left/right`, `last_fully_visible_line` (:792-816), scrollbar and
selection painting. `typewriter_rows_of_line` (nav.rs:500-522) stays sound: its early exit
fires on `content_len + prefix_width <= text_width`, and word wrap never produces MORE
rows than grapheme wrap for content that fits on one row. `visual_to_source`'s
end-of-row clamping already models short rows. The render row loop (render.rs:381-612)
consumes `VisualRow`/`prefix_width` unchanged. Folds, focus mode, centered measure, wrap
guide: orthogonal (the guide remains cosmetic at `wrap_column`).

### D6. Hot path

Per visible line, layout gains one linear `linebreaks()` pass + one break-cursor advance
inside the loop + bounded re-placement at row boundaries — O(visible line) total,
unchanged class. The `LayoutKey` cache gate (derive.rs:183-273) is untouched: layouts
recompute only when the key changes, exactly as today. No allocation growth beyond the
break-index vector (`Vec<usize>`, ≤ visible grapheme count; acceptable — same order as
`vgs` itself).

## Testing

**Updated pins (all enumerated from the code map; update expectations, never weaken the
property being tested):**
- layout.rs: `active_line_identity_and_wrap` (:513 — `"abcdef"` @ 4: NO break opportunity
  → rows unchanged `["abcd","ef"]`; assert that explicitly), `prefix_reduces_wrap_capacity`
  (:663 — `"- aaaa bbbb"` @ 6 now breaks at the space: rows become `aaaa` /
  `bbbb`-at-col-2, with the space hanging on row 0).
- render.rs `wrapped_list_item_continuation_row_aligns_text_and_caret` (:1909 —
  `"- aaaa bbbb cccc"` @ 12: recompute the break points; the round-trip contract itself
  is unchanged).
- nav.rs `screen_pos_wrapped_line_second_visual_row` (:1097) and
  `caret_in_tall_wrapped_line_stays_visible` (:1112): no break opportunities in their
  corpora (`abcdef`, `aaaa…`) — must pass UNCHANGED (they now pin the fallback).
- derive.rs `long_line_wraps_at_small_width` (:417), `rebuild_fills_editing_rows…` (:561):
  corpora use unbroken runs — verify unchanged or adjust corpus deliberately.
- md_parse.rs list tests (:461, :491, :522, :530): unchanged for unindented items; NEW
  cases for `"  - sub"` (visible = `sub`, glyph = `"  • "`), tab-indented, and nested
  ordered (`"   2. x"` → glyph `"   2. "`).
- tests/block_roles_integration.rs (:9): unchanged (unindented, no wrap at width 80).

**New pins:**
- Word-break unit cases: break after space; after hyphen in `self-referential`; after
  ` — ` (em-dash prose); NO break in `non\u{a0}breaking` (NBSP) or after the hyphen in a
  `-flag`-style token per UAX #14 classes; CJK `中文混排English` mixed-script breaks;
  fallback on `aaaaaaaa` and a long URL; trailing-space hang (row width may exceed vw by
  the space; the space remains placed — law 4).
- CodeBlock exemption: a fenced code line with spaces/hyphens wraps per-grapheme,
  byte-identical rows to today.
- B2: nested bullet paints at its indent column (render-level, via TestBackend); wrapped
  NESTED item's continuation row hangs under the item text (the B1×B2 composition — the
  effort's headline case); caret/click round-trip on that same wrapped nested item
  (offset_at_cell ↔ screen_pos).
- Proptest laws W1/W2 (D4) join the existing law suite over the existing token strategy
  (which already exercises é/中/🙂/ZWJ/ZWSP/combining marks, layout.rs:715-736).
- e2e Harness journey: type a paragraph past the viewport edge → no mid-word break on
  screen; navigate End/Home/up/down across the wrap; edit a nested list item until it
  wraps → bullet column + hanging indent visually pinned via `screen_contains` rows.

**Gates:** the standard set — suite green, workspace clippy deny, warning-free; smoke
quoted verbatim pre-merge (advisory). `cargo fuzz` targets and the F2 oracle are
unaffected (block_tree/incremental parsing untouched).

## Non-goals (explicit)

- No config axis for wrap; no `[view]` changes.
- No blockquote indent conceal; no task-list support; no soft-hyphen (U+00AD)
  render-time hyphenation (UAX #14 treats it as an opportunity — accepted as-is; no
  visible hyphen is synthesized at the break).
- No render.rs split (E3), no ColMap API changes, no nav.rs behavior changes beyond what
  the new geometry implies.
- Justification/alignment, hyphenation dictionaries: out of scope permanently unless the
  user asks.

## Ship-time bookkeeping

Backlog: B1 and B2 → SHIPPED (one entry note: combined effort); note the CodeBlock
exception and the UAX #14 dependency in the B1 entry. Memory: working order advances
(next = C4 per the recorded order). Ledger: standard per-task lines.
